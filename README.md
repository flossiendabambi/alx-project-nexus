# 🛒 Project Nexus: eCommerce Backend System

Welcome to **alx-project-nexus**, the documentation hub for my major backend engineering project — a fully-featured **eCommerce backend system**. Built using modern technologies like **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, **GraphQL**, and **Celery**, this project demonstrates practical backend architecture, robust API design, and real-world engineering practices.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This eCommerce backend powers a digital store where users can browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, and receive order updates — all through a clean API interface. The system is designed with scalability, maintainability, and performance in mind, making use of asynchronous tasks, background workers, and clean system architecture.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Django**: Web framework for rapid backend development
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: RESTful API implementation for frontend consumption
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query layer for modern frontend needs
- **Celery + RabbitMQ**: For background job processing (e.g., sending order confirmation emails)
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment (GitHub Actions)
- **Docker**: Containerization for development and deployment
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Redis**: Used for caching and as a Celery backend

## 🧠 Key Backend Concepts

### 🏗 System Design
- Modular app structure with separation of concerns
- Layered architecture: views, services, and models
- Scalable queue-based architecture for time-intensive tasks

### 🛒 Core Features
- User Authentication & Authorization
- Product & Category Management
- Cart & Checkout Flow
- Order Tracking
- Email Notifications using Celery
- Admin Panel for inventory control

### ⚙ Asynchronous Programming
- Offloading heavy or slow tasks like email and report generation
- Celery workers running with RabbitMQ and monitored in real-time

### 🚀 CI/CD & DevOps
- GitHub Actions: Run tests, lint code, and deploy to staging
- Dockerized setup: Runs everything (web app, DB, queue, workers) via `docker-compose`
- `.env` configuration for secure and scalable deployments

---

## 🧪 Challenges & Solutions

- **Problem**: Handling slow email delivery in checkout flow  
  **Fix**: Implemented Celery + RabbitMQ for async email sending

- **Problem**: Multiple nested serializers causing performance issues  
  **Fix**: Switched to flat serializers with prefetching and custom fields

- **Problem**: Ensuring frontend and backend sync during API integration  
  **Fix**: Added GraphQL endpoint for flexibility and implemented versioned REST APIs

---

## ✅ Best Practices & Takeaways

- Use `GenericViewSets` and serializers with strong validation logic
- Always write reusable components (signals, services, and tasks)
- Use `@transaction.atomic` to ensure DB consistency in complex flows
- Secure APIs with authentication (token-based or JWT)
- Always write docstrings, tests, and use linters like `flake8`

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

### With Backend Peers
- Collaborated on Dockerizing the stack and improving API performance
- Peer-reviewed PRs and pair-programmed on queue setup

### With Frontend Developers
- Shared Postman/Swagger docs and GraphQL schema for integration
- Provided detailed API contracts and test credentials

### Communication Channels
- Discord: `#ProDevProjectNexus`
- GitHub: Issues, PRs, and Projects boards

---

## 📢 First Week Focus
